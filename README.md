Steal Back Your Wage Gap

Because of the wage gap, women do 22% more work than their male peers. cacheMoney is a cpu hack that helps women steal back the wage gap by making them less 22% less productive. It uses a shell script that runs secretly in the background and cripples your CPU with redundant and repetitive tasks so your computer runs 22% slower. It can be installed on any mac or unix system and is a pedantic and subtle way to steal back power from your employers / capitalist overlords. 

Here's a video of the concept working here: https://www.instagram.com/p/BNc_XfSD24e/?taken-by=pizzalabs.
